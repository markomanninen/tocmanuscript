# 1. Introduction


## 1.1. Background of Nuclear Physics

The origins of nuclear physics can be traced back to the late 19th century when scientists began to probe the inner workings of the atom. The discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel in 1896, followed by Marie Curie's pioneering work on radium, laid the groundwork for understanding the nucleus's structure and behavior.

In 1911, Ernest Rutherford's groundbreaking experiment revealed that atoms have a dense central nucleus containing protons and neutrons, surrounded by orbiting electrons. This model replaced the earlier Thomson "plum pudding" model and set the stage for the development of quantum mechanics.

Niels Bohr's model of the atom in 1913 introduced quantized energy levels, explaining the spectral lines observed in hydrogen. This marked a significant step towards the development of quantum mechanics, a revolutionary theory that would transform physics.

James Chadwick's discovery of the neutron in 1932 provided a more complete understanding of the nucleus's composition. This finding opened the door to new research areas, including nuclear reactions and nuclear forces.

The 1930s and 1940s saw rapid advancements in understanding nuclear reactions, culminating in the discovery of nuclear fission by Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn. This discovery had profound implications, leading to the development of nuclear energy and the atomic bomb.

The latter half of the 20th century witnessed the development of the Standard Model, a theory that describes the fundamental particles and forces of nature. Ongoing research continues to push the boundaries of nuclear physics, exploring phenomena such as quarks, gluons, and the Higgs boson.

The background of nuclear physics is a tapestry of discovery, innovation, and exploration. From the early experiments with radioactivity to the cutting-edge research of today, nuclear physics has continually expanded our knowledge and challenged our perceptions. It is a field that continues to inspire, drive technological advancements, and deepen our understanding of the universe's fundamental nature.

# 3. The Discovery of Nuclear Fission


## 3.1. The Puzzling Experiment

In the annals of scientific discovery, few experiments have been as puzzling and transformative as the one that led to the understanding of nuclear fission. Conducted by Lise Meitner, Otto Hahn, and Fritz Strassmann, this experiment would ultimately reshape our understanding of the atomic nucleus and pave the way for a new era in nuclear science.

The experiment began with a simple yet profound question: What happens when uranium is bombarded with neutrons? To answer this question, the team set up a series of experiments using a neutron source and uranium targets. They carefully controlled the conditions, ensuring that the results would be as accurate as possible.

As the team bombarded the uranium with neutrons, they observed something truly puzzling. Instead of producing heavier elements as expected, the uranium seemed to be breaking down into lighter elements. This observation was in stark contrast to the prevailing understanding of nuclear reactions at the time.

The team meticulously analyzed the products of the reaction, identifying the presence of barium, a much lighter element than uranium. This finding was so unexpected that it initially led to disbelief and confusion.

The initial interpretations of the experiment were fraught with uncertainty. The presence of barium seemed to defy the known laws of nuclear physics. How could uranium, a heavy element, break down into something as light as barium?

Lise Meitner, with her deep understanding of nuclear physics, began to ponder the implications of the findings. Collaborating with her nephew Otto Frisch, she developed a theoretical explanation for the observations. They realized that the uranium nucleus was splitting into two roughly equal parts, releasing a tremendous amount of energy in the process. This phenomenon came to be known as nuclear fission.

## 3.2. The Breakthrough Insight

The breakthrough insight that allowed Lise Meitner and her collaborators to understand nuclear fission was a moment of profound scientific realization. It was a turning point that not only solved the puzzle of the unexpected experimental results but also opened a new frontier in nuclear physics.

The insight came after the puzzling observation that uranium was breaking down into lighter elements, specifically barium, when bombarded with neutrons. This phenomenon was contrary to the prevailing understanding of nuclear reactions, and it left the scientific community baffled.

Lise Meitner, a physicist with a deep understanding of nuclear physics, took on the challenge of unraveling this mystery. Collaborating with her nephew Otto Frisch, she began to explore the theoretical implications of the experimental findings.

The key to the breakthrough was the application of the liquid-drop model to the atomic nucleus. Meitner and Frisch realized that the uranium nucleus could be visualized as a liquid drop that could split into two roughly equal parts under certain conditions. This splitting would release a tremendous amount of energy, explaining the observations.

The role of key individuals in this discovery cannot be overstated. Meitner's theoretical insight, combined with the meticulous experimental work of Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, led to a comprehensive understanding of nuclear fission. The collaboration between these scientists, each contributing their unique expertise, was instrumental in achieving this breakthrough.
